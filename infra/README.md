# Infrastructure Directory

This directory contains infrastructure solutions for the project:

- `k8s/` — Kubernetes manifests (deployments, services, ingress, etc.)
- `terraform/` — Terraform configurations for cloud or local deployment
- `mongo/` — configs and manifests for MongoDB
- `postgres/` — configs and manifests for Postgres
- `minio/` — configs and manifests for MinIO (S3 alternative)

> Add all infrastructure-related files here for convenience and centralized management.
